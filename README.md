# Embedded Systems Individual Assignment
This repository contains the instructions and submission for my Y2S2 Embedded Systems individual assignment.

## Summarised Assignment Description
Developed a battery-powered LED lamp operated via an IR remote controller using an Arduino UNO. Designed the lamp to control 4 white LEDs and 1 multi-colour LED, with functionality controlled by the volume and channel buttons on a standard remote. Documented the design, circuit diagrams, and testing results in a detailed report. Participated in a viva session to demonstrate the project and explain design decisions, implementation, and testing.
